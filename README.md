This is a simple demonstration of the basic web technologies for the design students of University Macromedia.

We built a simple app screen using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How to get started:

- Create a file called "index.html"
- open it with notepad
- Paste the contents of "starter-template.html" in there
- save
- drag the file into your browser

--> You should see your new website!
